**Taskreset** is a program to reset a process. This way, you do not need Task Manager to restart that process.

# How to use
It is recommended to copy the script to `C:\Windows\system32` for easy access.
The syntax is: `taskreset <process name>
## Example
This command will restart the process `dwm.exe`.
```batchfile
taskreset dwm.exe
```
